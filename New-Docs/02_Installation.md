Below is a structured plan along with sample content improvements for your docs folder. I browsed the [docs folder](https://github.com/ShivamKR12/UrsinaForMobile/tree/main/docs) to understand its current state and here are some recommendations:

---

## 1. Restructure the Documentation

**Proposed File Organization:**

```
docs/
├── 00_Introduction.md
├── 01_Getting_Started.md
├── 02_Installation.md
├── 03_Build_and_Deployment.md
├── 04_Troubleshooting.md
├── 05_FAQ.md
└── 06_Contributing.md
```

**Benefits:**
- **Clarity:** Each file targets a specific topic.
- **Navigation:** An ordered sequence helps new users follow the project’s workflow.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to update individual sections.

---

## 2. Create a Clear Introduction

**File: `00_Introduction.md`**

*Example Content:*

```markdown
# Introduction

## What is Ursina For Mobile?

- **Purpose:** Enable Ursina-based games to run on Android devices.
- **Scope:** Currently supports Android only due to Panda3D's limitations with iOS.

## Who is this for?
