## Step 3: Configure Your Project üéÆ

1. **Create/Update `setup.py`:**  
   - Located in the **src/** folder.
   - Update the following key settings:
     - **Application Name and Version:**  
       ```python
       name='Your game name'
       version='Your game version'
       ```
     - **Application ID:**  
       ```python
       application_id='com.yourcompany.yourgame'
       ```
     - **Android Version Code:**  
       Increase this value before every release.
     - **Entry Point:**  
       Update the mapping for your game‚Äôs main file:
       ```python
       'yourappdisplayname': 'path/to/your/entry/python_file.py'
       ```

2. **Set Up Your Game Entry Point:**  
   - Open **src/game/__main__.py**.
   - Add these lines at the very top:
     ```python
     from setup_ursina_android import setup_ursina_android
     setup_ursina_android()
     ```

3. **Configure Android Setup:**  
   - Open **src/game/setup_ursina_android.py**.
   - Update the `app_id` to match the one in `setup.py`:
     ```python
     app_id = "com.yourcompany.yourgame"
     ```

4. **Additional Requirements:**  
   - If your project needs extra dependencies, add them to **src/requirements.txt** without removing existing entries.
