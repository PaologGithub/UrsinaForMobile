# Ursina For Mobile
### The new era of ursina
Did you ever wanted to export your ursina game for android?
Now you can, with this repo.

Only Android is supported now. I don't think iOS will ever be supported, because Panda3D doesn't support building for iOS, and I don't have an iPhone/Mac to test.

## I want to port my game for android
To do that, follow [the documentation](/docs/docs.md). Everything will be here.

## I need help
If you need help, if anything doesn't work, you can make an [issue](https://github.com/PaologGithub/UrsinaForMobile/issues), or start a new [discussion](https://github.com/PaologGithub/UrsinaForMobile/discussions).

Your error can be ursina-related too, so go to the [ursina engine discord](https://discord.com/invite/ydXfhyb), I'll be there too.
