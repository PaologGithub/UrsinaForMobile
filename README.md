## State of this project
This project isn't finished. There is problem everywhere, starting with ursina **not** working on android because of missing files, but with panda3d android problems too.

This solution **isn't** production-ready, so use it if you want to publish your little game for android, but if you want to publish a big game on it, with a lot of dependencies and assets, it'll just doesn't work.
