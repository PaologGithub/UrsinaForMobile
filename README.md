# UrsinaForMobile
### The new era of ursina
This repository will help you export your ursina game for mobile.
Only Android is supported now, and I don't think iOS will ever be supported.

Panda3D does not support building for iOS, and even if it could, I don't have an iPhone to test. Sorry, Apple lovers, but only Android is supported.


## How can I use ursina for mobile
Refer to [The Docs](/docs/docs.md) for instructions on installing Ursina on mobile devices.

## What to do if you need help
If you encounter issues or need assistance, you can start a new [discussion](https://github.com/PaologGithub/UrsinaForMobile/discussions), so I can help you out.

## State of this project
This project is in progress. There are a lot of issues.
-  First of all, Ursina **does not** work on Android, because of missing files.
-  Second, there are several issues with Panda3D for Android, such as app crashes when handling rotations.

This solution **isn't** production-ready.
If you want to use it, use it only if you want to export a little game, with minimal resources and dependencies.
For big games, this solution isn't suitable, so I recommend to remake your game in a cross-platform compilable language.
